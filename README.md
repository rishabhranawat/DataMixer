# Data Mixing Library

A Python library for mixing multiple datasets according to different mixing algorithms. This library provides a flexible framework for combining datasets while controlling the proportions of each dataset in the final mix.

## Overview

The library implements a modular design that separates the mixing algorithm from the sampling logic. This allows for easy implementation of new mixing strategies while maintaining a consistent interface for dataset mixing.
